# Endpoints examples

- http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=encenadaport&height=50&width=100
- http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=encenadaport&height=50
- http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=encenadaport&width=50

# Other Functionalities

If the user enters the width only or the height only alongside the filename, then I expected that the client would want to resize the width and height with the same number.
